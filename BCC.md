# BCC.md — Beyond Code Collective Project Bible

> This document is the single source of truth for the BCC website and career quiz. It captures every brand decision, technical pattern, safety measure, and institutional detail accumulated during development. If you're new to this project — human or AI — start here.

## Mission

Close the AI literacy gap and unlock digital dignity for communities long excluded from the future of work.

BCC is intergenerational by design: ages 7 to 107. Students, career changers, parents, educators, and seniors. English and Spanish speaking. Operating across the United States and Puerto Rico with hub locations planned. The website and quiz reflect all of this — bilingual from day one, split into youth (7-17) and adult (18+) tracks, with safety and legal protections appropriate for working with minors.

**Full name:** Beyond Code Collective
**Short name (after first reference):** Beyond Code
**Site:** [wearebcc.org](https://wearebcc.org)
**Brand designed by:** BASIC/DEPT (2026)

- "empower" / "empowerment"
- Gender-specific language
- "multiculturalism"
- Rags-to-riches framing
- "programs" (use **"initiatives"** instead)

### Design Language Signatures

- **Bracket notation:** `[01]`, `[ THE CODE ]`, `[ Lawyer > Dev ]`
- **Person attribution:** `// NAME //` with `< CITY, STATE >`
- **Section labels:** Numbered with SectionLabel component `[01] OF [06]`
- **Phosphor Icons:** Bold weight for UI, Regular for inline. Never use emoji as icons.

## Bilingual by Design (i18n)

BCC serves communities where English and Spanish are both primary languages. Bilingual support is not a translation layer added after the fact — it was built into the architecture from the start. Every screen, every disclaimer, every quiz question, every safety measure, and every results email exists in both languages. This includes the AI career guide chat, which responds in the user's selected locale.

The site also serves an intergenerational audience. The quiz splits into two tracks at entry: ages 7-17 (youth) and 18+ (adults). Each track gets age-appropriate course recommendations, different AI chat behavior, and different safety framing. The youth track includes parental guidance notices and age-appropriate language throughout. This is foundational to how BCC operates — not a feature toggle, but a core design principle.

**Supported locales:** English (`en`), Spanish (`es`)

**URL structure:**
```
/en          — English landing page
/es          — Spanish landing page
/en/quiz     — English quiz (v1, aspirational courses)
/en/quiz-v2  — English quiz (v2, real BCC catalog courses)
/es/quiz     — Spanish quiz
/es/quiz-v2  — Spanish quiz v2
```

**Translation namespaces** (in `src/messages/{locale}/`):
- `common.json` — nav, footer, newsletter, form labels, audience segments
- `landing.json` — all landing page section copy
- `quiz.json` — quiz v1 (placeholder courses)
- `quiz-v2.json` — quiz v2 (real BCC courses)

**Language toggle:** EN/ES pill in the nav bar. Electric Green active state. Visible on both desktop and mobile (not hidden in hamburger). Uses `GlobeSimple` Phosphor icon.

## Landing Page Architecture

### Section Order

| # | Component | Background | ID |
|---|-----------|------------|-----|
| — | `<Nav />` | Transparent > off-white on scroll | — |
| 1 | `<Hero />` | True Black | — |
| 2 | `<About />` | Off White | `#about` |
| 3 | `<Testimonials />` | Off White | — |
| 4 | `<Audience />` | Off White | — |
| 5 | `<Stats />` | True Black | — |
| 6 | `<Initiatives />` | Cobalt Blue | `#initiatives` |
| 7 | `<Founder />` | True Black | `#founder` |
| 8 | `<Resources />` | Forest Green | `#resources` |
| 9 | `<CTABridge />` | Dark Cobalt | `#partners` |
| 10 | `<GetInvolved />` | Electric Green | `#get-involved` |
| 11 | `<Footer />` | True Black | — |

### Signature Interactions

- **Hero shuffle text:** "EVERYONE" scrambles letter-by-letter, then cycles through "BUILDS.", "GROWS.", "LEARNS.", "LEADS." every 15 seconds
- **Hero photo viewer:** 7 community thumbnails control the main hero image. Clicking a thumbnail swaps with AnimatePresence. Counter shows `[01] OF [07]`
- **Floating face photos:** 12 portraits float with ambient animation (opacity pulses, subtle y/x drift)
- **Stats counter:** Numbers animate up from 0 when scrolled into view
- **Testimonials carousel:** AnimatePresence fade transitions with prev/next arrows
- **Partner logos:** CSS infinite scroll animation, pauses on hover

### AI Career Guide Chat

- **Model:** Claude Sonnet 4.5
- **Tone:** Casual, direct, 2-3 sentences max. Talks like a text message, not an essay.
- **Safety:** BCC topics only. Refuses off-topic/inappropriate requests. Youth mode uses age-appropriate language, no salary stress or workplace politics.
- **Rate limiting:** 50 requests per IP per hour, 20 messages per session
- **Storage:** Ephemeral. No conversation logs. This is by design for COPPA compliance.

### Results Email

Branded HTML email sent via Resend when user provides an email (auto-sent if given during capture, or via SaveResultsCard if they skipped). Includes: personality name, tagline, role, salary range, recommended courses, CTA to wearebcc.org. Localized for EN/ES. Youth emails frame the CTA differently.
